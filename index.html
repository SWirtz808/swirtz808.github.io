<h1 class="heading">Hello</h1>    
<p class="text">My name is Sabin Wirtz. I don't really consider myself interesting but three of the things that I like are playing games (of course), going on "adventures" (exploring nearby cool areas), and hanging out with my friends (if possible).  </p>

<p class="text">My favorite game that I like playing is Dead By Daylight or DBD for short. It's where you either play as a survivor where you have to repair generators to escape, or you can play as the killer to.. kill the survivors. It's not super popular and the community is pretty toxic but I still love and play it. I mostly play survivor although I'm starting to get play killer more. The table below shows off my top 3 favorite characters from both sides.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Dead by daylight is really one of the only things I can talk about that I know a lot of so sorry in advance.</p>
