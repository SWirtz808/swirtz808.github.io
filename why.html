<h1 class="heading">Why did I take this class?</h1>
<p class="text">The reason why I wanted to take this class is because I want to pursue an education/degree in computer science (and in math) since I want to become some sort of programmer in the future. I feel like this class will really help me on learning what I need to know for the future and so far, I feel like I already learned a lot. Wayy more than I knew before.</p>  

<h1 class="heading">What do I hope to benefit off of from this class?</h1>
<p class="text">Like I said, I hope to learn a lot about Computer Science since I want to pursue an education related to it.</p>
